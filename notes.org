* currently working on
- m & d should be constant within episode
- Horizon1 environment class (FUN)
  - run bottom cell, g updates one trial too early. troubleshoot.
  - based off of GridWorld (chatgpt)
- multi_g function
  - all_stims wrong shape, probably because of line 21
- need to decide on values of g
* todo
- make probabilistic variant
  - generator variant
* differences compared to previous version of the task
- difficulty is random at every trial (can change within episode)
* riccardo feedback
- "may have changed" \to "changed"
- maybe make top schematic clearer, indicate repitions more clearly
  - "episode 1", \to "episode 2"
  - think about including in text: "Each episode consists of two trials"
  - "environment 2/4", etc.
- increase episodes from 20 to at least 30
- should mention that only thing that matters is the quantities?
  - riccardo says probably not necessary
** thoughts after riccardo pilot
- risk aversion increases w/ uncertainty
  - make a pure exploration period?
    - period where participants don't lose any â‚¬ for sub-optimal performance
  - should say how many episodes per environment?
    - maybe would influence how explorative they are
